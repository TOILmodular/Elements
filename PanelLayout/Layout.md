## Panel Layout for PCB

The panel dimensions provided in the section "Original Design" below are based on my own module build, since I am not following the standard HP (1HP eq. 5.08mm) size. An alternative by building an HP-standard size panel can be found in the section "HP Standard Design" further below.

### Original Design
Coordinates given in the table fit to the layout of components given in the PCBs in folder GerberFiles.

Panel size: 205mm x 128.5mm

The numbers in the table are refering to the numbers in the picture below.
Coordinates origin is the lower left corner of the panel.

### HP Standard Design
For building the panel with a size following the HP standard, you can use the panel Gerber file provided in the folder "GerberFiles".
I ordered my own panel via such gerber file built out of PCB material.

Here are a few parameters of the panel.
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Width | 40HP |
| Pot hole diameter | 8mm |
| Jack hole diameter | 6.1mm |
| Tact switch hole diameter | 5.1 mm |
| LED hole diameter | 3.1mm|
| Mounting hole diameter | 3.2mm|
